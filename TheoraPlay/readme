# How to build

You'll need the Android NDK, and also cmake.

Easiest way to build all this is to checkout android-cmake from https://github.com/taka-no-me/android-cmake. Open a command prompt in the TheoraPlay folder (make sure cmake is in your path) and follow these instructions from the android-cmake readme:

	cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=android.toolchain.cmake \
      -DANDROID_NDK=<ndk_path>                       \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                     \
      -DANDROID_ABI="armeabi-v7a with NEON"          \
      .
	cmake --build .

This will build everything and put libtheoraplay.so in the Debug folder.
